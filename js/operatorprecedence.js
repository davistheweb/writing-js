// Operator precedence//


// Operator precedence in Javascript determines the order 
// In which operators are prased concerning each other



// Example 

let result = 2 + 3 * 4;

console.log(result)

let times = 2  * 3 ** 5

console.log(times)

console.log(3 **5)



// Operator Associativity

// Operator associativity in javascript defines the
// the order in which operator of the same precedence are evaluated

// types are:
// Left to right
// Right to left

// Left to right: This means that opertors are evaluated from left to right

let text = 4 - 2 - 1

console.log(text);

let text2 = 4 + 5 + 6;

console.log(text2);

// Right to left: this means that operators are evaluated from right to left


/// Example

let text3 = 2** 3 ** 2

console.log(text3)
